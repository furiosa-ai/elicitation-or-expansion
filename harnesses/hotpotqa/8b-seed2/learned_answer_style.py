"""Answer granularity learned from the train split instead of asserted in the prompt.

The frontier system retrieves well (gold-title recall 0.81) but still loses 37 of its 93 errors on items
where BOTH gold pages were in front of the answering call. Reading those 37 traces, the loss is almost never
knowledge -- it is the *level of detail* the answer is pitched at, and the prompt itself causes it. The
answering instruction asserts "the shortest span ... normally one to four words" and "drop descriptors", and
the model obeys: it returns the common form of a person's name where the reference keeps the full one, drops
the state or country after a city name, drops a leading year from an event name, and collapses a two-item
list. In the other direction it sometimes over-specifies, returning an official long form where the short
one was wanted. A hand-written rule cannot settle this, because the expected granularity is a *convention of
the question form*, not a property of the passage.

So this harness stops asserting it and learns it. `prepare` indexes the train split by the shape of its
questions -- the interrogative word plus its head noun, whether the question weighs two named things against
each other, and the token shape of the reference answer -- and keeps the raw (question, reference answer)
pairs. At answer time the harness selects the train questions closest in form and wording to the item being
solved and shows them to the answering call as solved examples, together with a style summary derived from
those very examples (their typical length, whether answers of this form keep a place or date qualifier,
whether they are proper names or lower-case common nouns, whether they are yes/no). The repair trigger is
also learned: an answer is "too long" relative to the selected examples rather than relative to a constant.

Retrieval, the coverage hop, the query gate and the evidence pool are byte-identical to the frontier, so the
whole delta is attributable to how the answering call is told what an answer looks like. No extra LLM call
and no extra retrieval: the demonstrations ride along in the prompt of a call that was already being made.

TRIAGE_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are running the first of two searches for a question that needs facts from two
different encyclopaedia pages.

`retrieved_titles` lists the pages already retrieved, and `passages` are their abstracts.

Produce:
- `facts`: the sentences from `passages` that bear on the question, copied word for word, each on its own
  line and prefixed with the page title. Write `none` if nothing in the passages is relevant.
- `answer_type`: one of yesno, person, organisation, location, date, number, title, other.
- `next_query`: the search query for the SECOND search. Follow these rules exactly:
  * it must name the ONE page that is still missing and is needed to finish the answer -- typically the
    entity the first page points to (a bridge), or, when the question compares two named things, the one
    of them that is not in `retrieved_titles` yet;
  * write it the way that page would be titled: a bare noun phrase of at most six words, optionally with
    a short disambiguating word (for example a year, a nationality or a category);
  * it must NOT be a sentence, must NOT contain a question mark, must NOT restate the question, and must
    NOT name a page that is already in `retrieved_titles`;
  * never state the answer in it;
  * `next_query` is never empty and is never `none`, `n/a` or `unknown`. If the first search already seems
    to settle the question, use the second search to check it: name the most specific *other* page the
    relevant passage points at -- the album, film, event, organisation or person the question depends on --
    written as that page's title. If the passages were all irrelevant, name the main subject of the question
    the way an encyclopaedia would title its page."""

ANSWER_INSTRUCTIONS = """Answer `question` from `passages`, which are encyclopaedia abstracts written as
`Title | text`, and from `facts`, which were copied out of the first search.

`solved_examples` are questions of the SAME FORM as this one that have already been marked correct, each
shown with its reference answer. They are your specification for what an answer looks like: how long it is,
whether it keeps a qualifier such as a state, a country or a year, whether it is a proper name written in
full or a lower-case common noun, and whether it is simply yes or no. `style_note` summarises them.
Use them for FORM ONLY -- their subject matter is unrelated to this question and never supplies its answer.

Produce `supporting_titles`: the titles of the one or two passages that actually justify the answer.
Then produce `answer_type`, and then `answer`.

Rules for `answer`:
- It must be the span of the passages that answers the question, pitched at the same level of detail as the
  reference answers in `solved_examples`. Do not compress below that level and do not pad above it.
- If answers of this form keep a trailing place or date qualifier, keep it; if they are bare, stay bare.
- `style_examples` and `style_note` never license dropping part of what the question actually asks for: if
  the question asks for a date, give the date and not only its year; if it asks for a full title, give the
  full title. Form follows the examples, content follows the question.
- If the reference answers of this form are people's names written out in full, write the name the way the
  passage's own opening sentence writes it rather than the short form you would say out loud.
- When the answer is two things, join them the way the examples join them.
- Never write a sentence, never restate the question, never explain, never add a closing period.
- Copy the span verbatim from the passages, keeping the original spelling, capitalisation, abbreviations
  and units, e.g. write a distance the way the passage writes it rather than expanding or converting it.
- A question that can be answered with yes or no must be answered with exactly `yes` or exactly `no`.
- A question that asks which of two named things has some property must be answered with just that one
  name; do not name both and do not say why.
- If the passages are incomplete, combine what they do say with the most likely reading and still commit
  to a single span; never answer that the information is missing."""

REPAIR_INSTRUCTIONS = """`draft` is a verbose or evasive attempt at answering `question` from `passages`.

Return only `answer`: the bare span that answers the question, normally one to four words, copied verbatim
from `passages` or from `draft`. No sentence, no explanation, no final period. Answer a yes/no question
with exactly `yes` or exactly `no`. When the question offers two named alternatives, return exactly one of
them, spelled as in the question. Never reply that the information is missing -- commit to the best span."""
