"""Candidate: the answer is produced by highlighting a span inside the source sentence, not by writing one.

Interaction depth is unchanged (4 LLM calls, 2 retrievals, k=7). Retrieval, extraction and the hop-2
planner are inherited from `shared_property_alignment` verbatim; the one mechanism under test is how
the final call delivers the answer.

Reference answers for this kind of question are spans a human highlighted inside one source sentence,
so their boundaries follow that sentence: the unit stays attached to the number, the noun the number
counts stays attached, the qualifier written into the place name stays attached. The parent asks for
"the shortest span that answers the question" as a free-text field, and a model writing free text
rebuilds the answer from its own head instead of cutting it out of the sentence -- it drops the unit,
drops the counted noun, drops the qualifier, or reaches for a name it never read.

Here the final call may not write an answer at all. It must reproduce the one source sentence with the
answer wrapped in `<<` `>>` markers, and code cuts the answer out from between them after checking
that the marked-up text really is that sentence. The boundary decision becomes a physical act on text
the model has in front of it -- where to open the marker and where to close it -- rather than a
generation. Verification is what makes it a mechanism: a markup that does not reproduce the sentence is
rejected and the plain field is used instead, and yes/no and either-or questions are exempt because
their answers are not spans of any sentence.

GAP_QUERY_INSTRUCTIONS = """One search has already been run. Plan the second and last one.

`titles_found` lists the articles that search returned and `evidence` the facts taken from them. The
question needs facts from two different articles, so exactly one article is still missing.

First set `missing_target` to the name of that missing article, as precisely as you can guess the title
an encyclopedia would give it: the person, work, place, organisation, species or event whose facts you
still lack. Two cases:
- the question names two things and the evidence covers only one of them -> the missing target is the
  other one, named exactly as the question names it;
- the question describes the missing thing indirectly ("the director of X", "the album that contains
  Y") -> resolve it first from the evidence and name the entity itself, not the description.
`missing_target` must be a proper name that could stand as the title of an article -- a person, work,
band, film, place, organisation or species. Never write a role or a relation ("the vocalist of X", "the
director of Y", "birthplace of Z"): if that is all you can say, then the article you actually need is
the one that would CONTAIN that fact, so name that entity instead (the band, the film, the album, the
person the question names).

Then set `query` to the search string. The index matches words literally against article titles and
their opening paragraph, so:
- write 2 to 8 words: the missing target's name, plus one or two words that disambiguate it (a type
  word like film, band, river, novel, or a year, only if the name alone is ambiguous);
- never write a question or a sentence, and use no question words (who, what, when, where, which, how);
- never include words describing facts you already have, and never include a name that is already in
  `titles_found` unless it is part of the missing target's own name;
- drop filler words entirely.
Output the query as bare keywords."""

ANSWER_INSTRUCTIONS = """Answer the question from the evidence lines, then state the answer in the exact
form a grader can match against a short reference answer.

First set `answer_type` to one of: yes_no, person, organisation, work, place, date, number, other.
Use yes_no whenever the question asks whether something holds (are/is/was/were/do/does/did/can/has/
have/both ... ?), even when the evidence is thin.

Then set `supporting_quote` to the one evidence line that contains the answer, copied exactly.

Then set `highlighted` by copying that same sentence out again -- every word of it, in order, exactly
as it is written -- with the answer wrapped in `<<` and `>>`. You are not writing the answer here, you
are marking where it already stands in the sentence, so:
- open the marker at the first word of the answer and close it at the last word of the answer;
- keep inside the markers everything the sentence attaches to the answer: the unit written after a
  number (`<<1065 m>>`), the noun a number counts (`<<six children>>`), the qualifier written into a
  place (`<<Melbourne, Australia>>`), the modifier written into a class (`<<alternate history
  novels>>`), the name spelled the way this sentence spells it;
- leave outside the markers the words that introduce or continue the sentence -- a leading `from`,
  `in`, `by`, `is`, `the`, a trailing `and ...`, `which ...`, `who ...`, a second thing the sentence
  goes on to mention that the question did not ask about;
- mark one span only, and never mark words that are not consecutive in the sentence;
- if no sentence in the evidence contains the answer, write `NONE` here and nothing else.

Then set `answer` under these rules:
- yes_no: write exactly `yes` or `no`. Nothing else -- no explanation, no restatement.
- otherwise: write exactly the words you put between `<<` and `>>`, with nothing added and nothing
  removed. If you wrote `NONE`, write instead the shortest span that answers the question, in the
  surface form a source would use.
- Never write a sentence, never restate the question, never add "the answer is", never explain why.
- Give exactly what was asked for and nothing more: no apposition, no extra qualifier, no country or
  state appended to a place name, no unit the quote does not attach to the number, no gloss in
  brackets, and keep any unit or word the quote does attach to it.
- When the question offers a choice between two named alternatives ("which was released first, A or
  B?", "who is older, A or B?", "which one has more members, A or B?"), the answer is one of those two
  names, written as the question writes it -- never the date, number or property that settled the
  comparison, and never both names.
- Otherwise answer the kind of thing the question asks for. A question about who performed, directed,
  wrote or founded something wants the name of the person, even when the evidence only names the group
  or company responsible; a question about where wants the place; about when, the date; about how many,
  the bare number. Never hand back an entity of the wrong kind just because the evidence names it --
  the group is not the singer, the album is not the song, the studio is not the director.
- The evidence is often incomplete. Commit to the single most likely answer anyway. If the evidence
  identifies the subject but not the asked-for property, answer from what you know about that subject,
  in the same short form. Never answer "not specified", "unknown", "cannot be determined", and never
  mention the evidence or its gaps in the `answer` field."""

PAIR_ANSWER_INSTRUCTIONS = """The question puts two named things side by side. Line them up one at a
time, decide, and then state the answer in the exact form a grader can match against a short reference
answer.

`comparison_kind` says which job the question is asking for:
- `choice` -- it offers two named alternatives and wants one of them handed back;
- `shared` -- it wants the property, class or relation the two things have in common.

Set `entity_a` and `entity_b` to the two things, named as the question names them.

Set `fact_a` to what is true of `entity_a` on the single point the question turns on -- the date, the
number, the occupation, the class of thing it belongs to, the country -- copied in the wording of the
article about `entity_a`. Then set `fact_b` the same way for `entity_b`, from the article about
`entity_b`. For both rows:
- take the fact from that entity's own article. A sentence from the other entity's article, or from an
  article about something else with a similar name, is not evidence about this one.
- copy the article's wording rather than rewording it, and keep it to the phrase that matters.
- if no line covers that entity, write what you reliably know about it in the same short form and add
  `(from knowledge)`. Never leave a row empty and never write that it is missing.

Set `decision` in one sentence:
- `choice`: compare the two rows on the point asked about -- earlier, older, larger, the one that did
  the thing -- and name the winning entity.
- `shared`: give what the two rows have in common. If the question asks which person, work or place is
  common to both, name it. Otherwise give the wording that covers both rows, preferring wording that
  actually occurs in both rows, or in the question, over a broader category of your own; if the two rows
  word the same thing differently, take the wording the articles use for the class itself.

Then set `highlighted`. For a `choice` question write `NONE`. For a `shared` question, copy out the
one source sentence that states the shared class or property -- every word of it, in order, exactly as
written -- with that wording wrapped in `<<` and `>>`; keep inside the markers only the words the
sentence uses for the thing the two share, and write `NONE` if no sentence states it.

Then set `answer`:
- if the question asks whether something holds rather than which or what, write exactly `yes` or `no`.
- `choice`: write one of `entity_a` or `entity_b`, spelled as the question spells it. Never the date,
  number or property that settled the comparison, never both names, never a sentence.
- `shared`: write only what the two have in common -- one short noun phrase, singular unless the
  question asks about several things at once, in the source's wording. No `and`, no pairing of two
  wordings, no "both are", no explanation. When the question asks which *person*, *work* or *place*
  they have in common ("which actor was in both A and B"), what they share is that entity, so write its
  name; otherwise write the class or property itself and no entity name.
- Never restate the question, never add "the answer is", never explain why.
- Give exactly what was asked for and nothing more: no apposition, no extra qualifier, no country or
  state appended to a place name, no gloss in brackets.
- The evidence is often incomplete. Commit to the single most likely answer anyway, from what you know
  about the entities if need be. Never answer "not specified", "unknown", "neither", "not related" or
  "cannot be determined", and never mention the evidence or its gaps in the `answer` field."""
