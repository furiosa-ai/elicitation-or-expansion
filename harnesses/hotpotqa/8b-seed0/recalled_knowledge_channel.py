"""Candidate: what the model already knows about the named target becomes an explicit evidence channel.

Interaction depth is unchanged (4 LLM calls, 2 retrievals, k=7). Retrieval, the gap-directed second
query and the answer contract are inherited unchanged from `gap_directed_hop2`; the one mechanism
under test is a second, clearly separated *recall* channel feeding the final call.

Motivation from the parent's traces: two thirds of its remaining errors are items where a needed
article was never retrieved. Two retrievals of seven passages cannot fix that -- measured offline,
the parent's own query strategy is already the best single second query available, so the remaining
head-room on those items is not retrieval but what the answerer does when the passages identify the
subject and stay silent about the property being asked for. There the parent's answer instructions
say "answer from what you know about that subject", but by then the same call is also being told to
name a supporting quote and copy a span out of it, so the model has nowhere to consider its own
knowledge and frequently answers `not specified` or copies the nearest wrong span.

This candidate gives that knowledge a place. The planner call already has to name the article it is
missing, which is itself an act of recall; here it additionally writes `recalled` -- a couple of
short factual lines about that named entity, from memory, bearing on what the question asks. The
lines are generated *after* the query field so the query is conditioned exactly as before. The final
call then sees two labelled channels, `evidence` (verbatim retrieved sentences) and `recall`
(unverified memory), under an explicit precedence rule: the retrieved text wins whenever it states
the asked-for property, memory is used only to fill a gap, and the answer is never a non-answer.

GAP_QUERY_INSTRUCTIONS = """One search has already been run. Plan the second and last one.

`titles_found` lists the articles that search returned and `evidence` the facts taken from them. The
question needs facts from two different articles, so exactly one article is still missing.

First set `missing_target` to the name of that missing article, as precisely as you can guess the title
an encyclopedia would give it: the person, work, place, organisation, species or event whose facts you
still lack. Two cases:
- the question names two things and the evidence covers only one of them -> the missing target is the
  other one, named exactly as the question names it;
- the question describes the missing thing indirectly ("the director of X", "the album that contains
  Y") -> resolve it first from the evidence and name the entity itself, not the description.
`missing_target` must be a proper name that could stand as the title of an article -- a person, work,
band, film, place, organisation or species. Never write a role or a relation ("the vocalist of X", "the
director of Y", "birthplace of Z"): if that is all you can say, then the article you actually need is
the one that would CONTAIN that fact, so name that entity instead (the band, the film, the album, the
person the question names).

Then set `query` to the search string. The index matches words literally against article titles and
their opening paragraph, so:
- write 2 to 8 words: the missing target's name, plus one or two words that disambiguate it (a type
  word like film, band, river, novel, or a year, only if the name alone is ambiguous);
- never write a question or a sentence, and use no question words (who, what, when, where, which, how);
- never include words describing facts you already have, and never include a name that is already in
  `titles_found` unless it is part of the missing target's own name;
- drop filler words entirely.
Output the query as bare keywords.

Finally set `recalled`. The search may fail, so write down what you already know about
`missing_target` that bears on this question, from your own knowledge and not from `evidence`. Write
at most 3 lines, one fact per line, in the form:

Target name :: the fact, stated plainly

Rules for `recalled`:
- Only facts about the entity you named, and only ones the question could depend on -- the property
  it asks about, the entity's kind, its date, its place, the people or works tied to it.
- State a fact only if you actually hold it. If the name means nothing to you, write `unknown` on a
  single line rather than inventing something plausible.
- These lines are unverified memory, not evidence. Never copy them out of `evidence`, and never
  restate the question as if it were a fact."""

ANSWER_INSTRUCTIONS = """Answer the question from two channels, then state the answer in the exact form
a grader can match against a short reference answer.

`evidence` holds sentences copied verbatim out of the source articles: verified, but often incomplete.
`recall` holds a few facts written from memory about the entity the searches were aiming at:
unverified, and possibly wrong or about the wrong entity. Use them in this order:
- If `evidence` states the property the question asks about, answer from `evidence`. It outranks
  `recall` on every point where the two disagree.
- If `evidence` identifies the subject of the question but says nothing about the asked-for property,
  and `recall` supplies it for that same subject, answer from `recall`.
- If `recall` is about an entity that `evidence` shows is not the one the question means, ignore it.
- If neither supplies the property, answer with the single most likely value anyway.

First set `answer_type` to one of: yes_no, person, organisation, work, place, date, number, other.
Use yes_no whenever the question asks whether something holds (are/is/was/were/do/does/did/can/has/
have/both ... ?), even when the evidence is thin.

Then set `supporting_quote` to the one line that contains the answer, copied exactly -- from
`evidence` when the answer came from there, otherwise the `recall` line it came from.

Then set `answer` under these rules:
- yes_no: write exactly `yes` or `no`. Nothing else -- no explanation, no restatement.
- otherwise: write the shortest span that answers the question, copied from the supporting quote in
  the exact surface form used there. A name, a title, a date, a number, or a short noun phrase.
- Never write a sentence, never restate the question, never add "the answer is", never explain why.
- Give exactly what was asked for and nothing more: no apposition, no extra qualifier, no country or
  state appended to a place name, no unit the quote does not attach to the number, no gloss in
  brackets, and keep any unit or word the quote does attach to it.
- When the question offers a choice between two named alternatives ("which was released first, A or
  B?", "who is older, A or B?", "which one has more members, A or B?"), the answer is one of those two
  names, written as the question writes it -- never the date, number or property that settled the
  comparison, and never both names.
- Otherwise answer the kind of thing the question asks for. A question about who performed, directed,
  wrote or founded something wants the name of the person, even when the evidence only names the group
  or company responsible; a question about where wants the place; about when, the date; about how many,
  the bare number. Never hand back an entity of the wrong kind just because the evidence names it --
  the group is not the singer, the album is not the song, the studio is not the director.
- The evidence is often incomplete. Commit to the single most likely answer anyway. If the evidence
  identifies the subject but not the asked-for property, answer from what you know about that subject,
  in the same short form. Never answer "not specified", "unknown", "cannot be determined", and never
  mention the evidence or its gaps in the `answer` field."""
