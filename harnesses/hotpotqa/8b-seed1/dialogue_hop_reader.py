"""Read both lookups inside ONE conversation instead of two independent, stateless calls.

Measured motivation (frontier traces, 300 search-set items):

    errors whose reference string is already inside the answering prompt        44 / 89
    accuracy when both needed articles are in the pool                          0.868
    accuracy when the second lookup completes the pair                          0.895

So roughly half the remaining loss is made with the evidence in hand. Every system so far has the
same seam: call 1 reads seven openings and writes a digest, call 2 is a FRESH request that re-reads
fourteen undifferentiated openings plus that digest. The digest is written before the lookup, so it
structurally cannot mention what the lookup returned; the reader's own chain of thought about why it
wanted the lookup is thrown away; and the seven articles it already rejected arrive again with the
same status as the new ones. Sibling attempts patched this with extra output FIELDS (a provisional
answer to revise, a newly-fetched title list) and lost ground, because they rewrote the contract.

Mechanism under test (architecture, not prompting): the two calls become two turns of a single
conversation. Turn 1 is the reader's existing request, byte for byte. Its reply is appended as the
assistant turn, so the model keeps its own stated evidence, its named target and its query as its
own prior words. Turn 2 is a short user turn that reports the lookup as an EVENT -- the query that
was sent and only the articles it added that were not already in hand -- and asks for the answer.
Old evidence is never repeated: it is above, in the conversation, already attributed to turn 1.

This costs the same two calls and the same two lookups and sends strictly fewer tokens than the
parent, and the answer contract, the typed projection and the source-voicing gate are unchanged, so
the delta isolates conversational state against digest-passing.

Budget: 2 LLM calls, 2 retrievals, k=7.

GAP_INSTRUCTIONS = """`passages` are the articles a sparse full-text index returned for the question
itself, and they are already in hand. Usually they cover only ONE of the two articles this question
needs. You get exactly one more lookup. Find the gap and aim it.

`facts`: copy out, verbatim, only the sentences or clauses from `passages` that bear on the
question, each prefixed with the article title in brackets. Copy numbers, dates and full names
exactly. If nothing is relevant, write "none".

`missing_target`: name the article still needed and say why the question needs it -- the entity the
question mentions but no passage above covers, or the entity the question only describes
indirectly. If the passages have now NAMED that entity, give the name. If they have not, describe
it with the question's own words.
There is essentially always a second article: an entity that a passage merely NAMES is not covered
by that passage, so if the question asks for a property of it -- a date, a place, a number, a
person, a title -- that entity's own article is what is missing. Only write "none" if the exact
answer to the question is already quoted word for word in `facts`; a lookup you decline is a lookup
thrown away.

`next_query`: the query for the final lookup, scored by a sparse index over article openings, so
write the words that the missing article's OWN OPENING would contain: the subject's name, plus the
two or three words that pin down what kind of thing it is (its type, field, place, role or date).
- Aim it at `missing_target`, not at the question. Do not hand the question back: the titles listed
  in `titles_in_hand` are already retrieved, and a query that returns them again buys nothing.
- Drop question words ("which", "who", "both", "same", "more", "first") and punctuation.
- If the question named two entities and only one was retrieved, this query is for the other one.
- Search terms only: no prose, no explanation, no quotation marks, at most about ten words."""

ANSWER_INSTRUCTIONS = """Answer the question from the evidence: `facts` are the sentences already
extracted, `passages` are the raw article openings retrieved for this question.

First quote the single piece of evidence that settles the question, then declare the shape of the
answer, then give the answer itself.

`answer_type` must be exactly one of: yes_no, person, organization, work_title, place, date, number, other.

`answer` is graded by exact string match against a short reference span, so it must be the bare
answer and nothing else:
- Never a sentence. Never restate the question. No explanation, no reason, no "because", no
  trailing clause, no second sentence, no markdown, no quotation marks, no final period.
- If `answer_type` is yes_no, `answer` must be exactly `yes` or `no` -- one word, nothing after it.
  Questions of the form "are both ...", "do both ...", "is X the same as Y", "can both ..." are
  yes_no questions, even when the interesting content is in the reasoning.
- If the question offers a closed list of options ("A or B", "which of ..."), copy the winning
  option exactly as the question spells it, and nothing else.
- Otherwise copy the answer span verbatim from the evidence, in the shortest form that fully
  names it: just the name, the title, the place, the date or the number.
- Do not add appositives, descriptors, units of explanation or parentheses that the reference
  span would not contain.
- If the evidence is incomplete, still give the single most likely bare answer. Never answer
  "unknown", "not stated" or "cannot be determined"."""
