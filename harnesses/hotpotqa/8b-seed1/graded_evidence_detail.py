"""Spend the answering call's context where the answer can be: full text for focal articles,
identity line only for the rest.

The parent (`source_named_answer`, 70.3%) hands the answering call fourteen complete article
openings, roughly 3.8k prompt tokens, of which its own traces show only two ever matter. Bucketing
its 300 search-set items by which hop supplied the target articles:

    hop A holds both                102 items   acc 0.843   (16 errors)
    hop A holds one, hop B the other 86 items   acc 0.895   ( 9 errors)
    hop A holds one, hop B misses    85 items   acc 0.494   (43 errors)
    neither                          18 items   acc 0.056   (17 errors)

The 25 errors in the first two rows are made with sufficient evidence in the window, and reading
them the failure is discrimination, not knowledge: an entity of the right type is returned from a
non-target article that happened to score well on the sparse index (the co-star instead of the
director, the tribute album instead of the studio album, the organisation instead of the person).
The obvious remedy -- delete the low-value passages -- has already been tried and cost 2.7 points,
and the traces of that attempt show why: deleting an article also deletes the sentence that says
what the article's subject IS, so the model loses the ability to tell the entities apart at all.

Mechanism under test (context construction; retrieval, both prompts, both output contracts and
every answer projection are frozen): detail is GRADED instead of gated. Every retrieved article
keeps its place and its opening naming sentence, so every candidate entity is still identifiable
and can still be ruled out. Only the BODY of a non-focal article is dropped. An article is focal
when the question names it, when the planning call's `facts` or `missing_target` names it, or when
the sparse index put it in the top two of either lookup -- i.e. when something other than raw
lexical score has pointed at it. Focal articles are shown in full.

This is the opposite bet to passage gating: keep breadth (all fourteen subjects stay visible and
attributable) and cut depth (bodies of articles nothing has pointed at), rather than keeping depth
and cutting breadth. It also lowers prompt tokens, so a tie on accuracy is still a Pareto move.

Budget: 2 LLM calls, 2 retrievals, k=7.

GAP_INSTRUCTIONS = """`passages` are the articles a sparse full-text index returned for the question
itself, and they are already in hand. Usually they cover only ONE of the two articles this question
needs. You get exactly one more lookup. Find the gap and aim it.

`facts`: copy out, verbatim, only the sentences or clauses from `passages` that bear on the
question, each prefixed with the article title in brackets. Copy numbers, dates and full names
exactly. If nothing is relevant, write "none".

`missing_target`: name the article still needed and say why the question needs it -- the entity the
question mentions but no passage above covers, or the entity the question only describes
indirectly. If the passages have now NAMED that entity, give the name. If they have not, describe
it with the question's own words.
There is essentially always a second article: an entity that a passage merely NAMES is not covered
by that passage, so if the question asks for a property of it -- a date, a place, a number, a
person, a title -- that entity's own article is what is missing. Only write "none" if the exact
answer to the question is already quoted word for word in `facts`; a lookup you decline is a lookup
thrown away.

`next_query`: the query for the final lookup, scored by a sparse index over article openings, so
write the words that the missing article's OWN OPENING would contain: the subject's name, plus the
two or three words that pin down what kind of thing it is (its type, field, place, role or date).
- Aim it at `missing_target`, not at the question. Do not hand the question back: the titles listed
  in `titles_in_hand` are already retrieved, and a query that returns them again buys nothing.
- Drop question words ("which", "who", "both", "same", "more", "first") and punctuation.
- If the question named two entities and only one was retrieved, this query is for the other one.
- Search terms only: no prose, no explanation, no quotation marks, at most about ten words."""

ANSWER_INSTRUCTIONS = """Answer the question from the evidence: `facts` are the sentences already
extracted, `passages` are the raw article openings retrieved for this question.

First quote the single piece of evidence that settles the question, then declare the shape of the
answer, then give the answer itself.

`answer_type` must be exactly one of: yes_no, person, organization, work_title, place, date, number, other.

`answer` is graded by exact string match against a short reference span, so it must be the bare
answer and nothing else:
- Never a sentence. Never restate the question. No explanation, no reason, no "because", no
  trailing clause, no second sentence, no markdown, no quotation marks, no final period.
- If `answer_type` is yes_no, `answer` must be exactly `yes` or `no` -- one word, nothing after it.
  Questions of the form "are both ...", "do both ...", "is X the same as Y", "can both ..." are
  yes_no questions, even when the interesting content is in the reasoning.
- If the question offers a closed list of options ("A or B", "which of ..."), copy the winning
  option exactly as the question spells it, and nothing else.
- Otherwise copy the answer span verbatim from the evidence, in the shortest form that fully
  names it: just the name, the title, the place, the date or the number.
- Do not add appositives, descriptors, units of explanation or parentheses that the reference
  span would not contain.
- If the evidence is incomplete, still give the single most likely bare answer. Never answer
  "unknown", "not stated" or "cannot be determined"."""
