"""Make the answering call EXHIBIT the two-article chain instead of quoting one sentence.

Measured motivation (replayed over the parent system's 300 search-set traces; the parent's queries,
its pool and its answer projections are reproduced byte for byte):

    the single quoted sentence contains the reference span    214 items, accuracy 0.902
    it does not                                                86 items, accuracy 0.209

The quote is a near-perfect predictor, and 26 of the parent's errors are made with the reference
span sitting in the prompt but a DIFFERENT sentence quoted. Reading them, the miss has one shape:
the parent reads the asked property off the article the question already names instead of off the
article about the entity the question does not name. It returns the writers of a film when the
question asked for its director, a company when the question asked a nationality, the party when
the question asked for the person, the album the question mentioned rather than the one the
recording came from. One quote slot cannot express a two-article dependency, so nothing in the
output forces the second article to be read at all -- a single sentence from the anchor article
satisfies the contract.

Mechanism under test (evidence structure inside one call; retrieval, queries and the pool are
frozen): the answering call must emit the chain as TWO verbatim quotes drawn from two DIFFERENT
articles -- `link_one`, the sentence in the article the question names that identifies the entity
the question only describes, then `bridge_entity`, that entity by name, then `link_two`, the
sentence in THAT entity's own article which states the asked property -- and the answer must be
read off `link_two`. Comparison questions use the same two slots for the matching fact about each
of the two named entities. A deterministic check notes when both links come from the same article
(the failure signature above) and, when the answer is absent from `link_two` but present in
`link_one`, the answer is kept as written rather than forced.

Answer projection, source voicing, both queries and the evidence pool are identical to
`source_named_answer`, so any delta is a delta of the evidence structure the call must produce.

Budget: 2 LLM calls, 2 retrievals, k=7.

GAP_INSTRUCTIONS = """`passages` are the articles a sparse full-text index returned for the question
itself, and they are already in hand. Usually they cover only ONE of the two articles this question
needs. You get exactly one more lookup. Find the gap and aim it.

`facts`: copy out, verbatim, only the sentences or clauses from `passages` that bear on the
question, each prefixed with the article title in brackets. Copy numbers, dates and full names
exactly. If nothing is relevant, write "none".

`missing_target`: name the article still needed and say why the question needs it -- the entity the
question mentions but no passage above covers, or the entity the question only describes
indirectly. If the passages have now NAMED that entity, give the name. If they have not, describe
it with the question's own words.
There is essentially always a second article: an entity that a passage merely NAMES is not covered
by that passage, so if the question asks for a property of it -- a date, a place, a number, a
person, a title -- that entity's own article is what is missing. Only write "none" if the exact
answer to the question is already quoted word for word in `facts`; a lookup you decline is a lookup
thrown away.

`next_query`: the query for the final lookup, scored by a sparse index over article openings, so
write the words that the missing article's OWN OPENING would contain: the subject's name, plus the
two or three words that pin down what kind of thing it is (its type, field, place, role or date).
- Aim it at `missing_target`, not at the question. Do not hand the question back: the titles listed
  in `titles_in_hand` are already retrieved, and a query that returns them again buys nothing.
- Drop question words ("which", "who", "both", "same", "more", "first") and punctuation.
- If the question named two entities and only one was retrieved, this query is for the other one.
- Search terms only: no prose, no explanation, no quotation marks, at most about ten words."""

ANSWER_INSTRUCTIONS = """Answer the question from the evidence: `facts` are the sentences already
extracted, `passages` are the raw article openings retrieved for this question.

This question needs TWO articles, and you must show both. Fill the chain in order.

`link_one`: copy out, word for word, the ONE sentence from `passages` that starts the chain --
the sentence, in an article the question NAMES, which identifies the entity the question only
describes ("the actor who...", "the film based on...", "the agent whose..."). Prefix it with its
article title in brackets.

`bridge_entity`: that entity, by name, exactly as `link_one` writes it. If the question names two
entities outright and simply compares them, write `comparison` here instead.

`link_two`: copy out, word for word, the ONE sentence that closes the chain -- the sentence stating
the property the question actually ASKS FOR. Prefix it with its article title in brackets.
- It must come from a DIFFERENT article than `link_one`. The asked property belongs to
  `bridge_entity`, so look in the article ABOUT `bridge_entity`, not in the article that merely
  mentions it. Two quotes from one article means one of them is the wrong sentence.
- For a `comparison`, `link_one` and `link_two` are the matching facts about the first and the
  second named entity, one sentence each, still from two different articles.
- If no passage states the asked property, quote the sentence that comes closest and say nothing
  else -- never leave this empty.

`answer_type` must be exactly one of: yes_no, person, organization, work_title, place, date, number, other.

`answer` is read off `link_two`, and is graded by exact string match against a short reference
span, so it must be the bare answer and nothing else:
- Never a sentence. Never restate the question. Never name `bridge_entity` when the question asked
  for a property OF it. No explanation, no "because", no trailing clause, no second sentence, no
  markdown, no quotation marks, no final period.
- If `answer_type` is yes_no, `answer` must be exactly `yes` or `no` -- one word, nothing after it,
  decided by comparing `link_one` against `link_two`. Questions of the form "are both ...",
  "do both ...", "is X the same as Y", "can both ..." are yes_no questions, even when the
  interesting content is in the reasoning.
- If the question offers a closed list of options ("A or B", "which of ..."), copy the winning
  option exactly as the question spells it, and nothing else.
- Otherwise copy the answer span verbatim out of `link_two`, in the shortest form that fully
  names it: just the name, the title, the place, the date or the number.
- Do not add appositives, descriptors, units of explanation or parentheses that the reference span
  would not contain.
- If the evidence is incomplete, still give the single most likely bare answer. Never answer
  "unknown", "not stated" or "cannot be determined"."""
