"""Search for the missing article with a written draft OF that article, not with keywords about it.

97 of 300 search-set items still reach the answerer with a required article missing, and those items score
39% against 85% for the fully covered ones -- recall, not reading, is what the frontier is short of.  Eleven
iterations of query work have moved gold-title recall between 0.71 and 0.855 and no further, because every
attempt has searched with the SAME vocabulary: the question's own words, the names it mentions, or a title
guessed from parametric memory.  All three fail on the same shape of item -- a second-hop article that the
question never names and the model has never memorised, described only obliquely ("the game a studio put out
that year", "the town a wall ran south of").  A keyword query built from such a description is a bag of
low-information terms and the lexical index ranks popularity instead.

The article itself, though, is written in a register the index shares.  Encyclopedia abstracts open the same
way -- "<name> is a 2016 platform adventure video game developed by <studio> for Microsoft Windows" -- and
the discriminating terms of that sentence are the type words, the role words and the domain vocabulary, none
of which require knowing the name.  So this harness, when routing reports a fact still missing, spends one
call WRITING THE MISSING ARTICLE'S OPENING SENTENCE: a plausible abstract-style lead for whatever entity
would carry that fact, deliberately with the name left as a blank.  That sentence is then handed to the
index verbatim as the query, and a second query keeps only its content words, so the match is made on the
descriptive vocabulary of the target article rather than on the interrogative vocabulary of the question.

Both pseudo-article queries are ADDITIVE: they are issued alongside the frontier's keyword follow-up and
their results are appended to the back of the same pool, so the mechanism can only add recall.  Name-slate
disambiguation, routing and the answer policy are unchanged from the frontier system.

ANALYZE_INSTRUCTIONS = """A multi-step question is about to be looked up in an encyclopedia whose search ranks
articles by popularity. Prepare the lookup.

Many names are shared by several articles -- a novel and the film made from it, two songs, a place and a much
bigger place with the same name, several films released in different years. The search will return the FAMOUS
one. To pick the right one instead, two things are needed.

In `reasoning`, work out which entity the question is really about and what in the question rules out the
better-known things sharing its name.

Produce:
- `names`: the proper names, work titles and place names that the question MENTIONS, one per line, most
  ambiguous first, at most three. Write each one bare, exactly as the article about it would be titled: no
  quotation marks, no year, no descriptive words the question wrapped around it, nothing invented. Write
  `none` if the question mentions no name at all.
- `constraints`: the checklist the intended article must satisfy, one short requirement per line, at most
  four. Take these from the question only -- what KIND of thing it is (film, novel, song, album, person,
  town, team), when it appeared, where it is from, what role it played. Do not guess facts the question does
  not state. Write `none` if the question states no distinguishing property."""

DISAMBIGUATE_INSTRUCTIONS = """A name in a question matches several different encyclopedia articles. Choose
the one the question is about.

You are given the checklist of properties the intended article must satisfy, and the candidate articles the
encyclopedia actually holds under each name, numbered, each shown as `Title | opening of the article`.

Judge by the checklist, not by fame. The best known article under a name is usually NOT the one an
indirect question is about: if the question says a novel, a candidate that opens by describing a film fails
the checklist however famous it is; if the question fixes a year, a nationality or a role, a candidate whose
opening contradicts it is out. A candidate that merely fails to mention a property does not violate it --
only an outright contradiction does.

In `reasoning`, go name by name and say which candidates each checklist item eliminates.

Produce `picks`: one line per name, written `<name> = <number>`, giving the number of the surviving candidate.
Write `<name> = none` when every candidate contradicts the checklist, or when two survive and nothing in the
question separates them. Guessing when nothing separates the candidates is worse than `none`."""

ROUTE_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are routing a keyword search that must gather every fact needed to answer a
multi-step question.

The passages are numbered search results. Passages listed first are articles that were chosen as the intended
meaning of a name in the question, in preference to better known articles sharing that name; trust them over
a passage further down that looks similar but describes a different thing. The rest come from a plain search
and may be about the wrong namesake entirely.

In `reasoning`, decide which chain of facts the question needs, then check which links of that chain the
passages already establish, and watch for passages that share a name with the subject but contradict the
question (wrong year, wrong medium, wrong country).

Produce:
- `useful`: the numbers of the passages that state a needed fact, most important first, comma separated.
  Include a passage only if it carries a fact the answer depends on; write `none` if no passage does.
- `missing`: the single fact still needed, named concretely (for example the specific entity whose property
  must still be looked up). Write `none` if every needed fact is present.
- `next_query`: a keyword query for that missing fact, anchored on the exact entity name as it appears in the
  passages, plus the property being sought. Leave it empty when nothing is missing. Never repeat a query whose
  results are already listed.
- `sufficient`: `yes` if the passages already contain every fact needed to answer, otherwise `no`."""

IMAGINE_INSTRUCTIONS = """A search of an encyclopedia has not turned up the article that carries a needed
fact. You will write a draft of that article's opening sentence so the search can be run against it.

Encyclopedia abstracts open in a fixed register: the subject, then what kind of thing it is, then the
defining specifics -- the year, the medium, the country, the studio, the office, the league, the discipline,
the works it is known for. Write that sentence for the article that would contain the missing fact.

You do not know the subject's name and must not invent one: write `___` wherever the name would go. Do not
copy the question's phrasing or its question words. Use the vocabulary the real article would use: concrete
type nouns, the field's technical terms, dates, places, roles. Prefer specific words over general ones --
`platform adventure video game developed by` says more than `a game made by`. One or two sentences, at most
forty words, no hedging and no explanation of what you are doing.

In `reasoning`, say what kind of article must hold the missing fact and which specifics the question already
fixes about it.

Produce `opening`: the drafted opening sentence."""
