"""The second hop searches with a written-out article opening, not with a name and a keyword.

Mechanism change vs the parent (`grounded_answer_repair`). The parent turns its second hop into
queries of the shape `<pivot name> <property words>`. Against a bag-of-words index that is a weak
signal: two or three terms, most of them shared with thousands of abstracts, and the one term that
would separate the right article -- the answer itself -- is by definition unknown.

This system searches with a synthesized DOCUMENT instead of a query. Having read the pool once, the
model writes the opening sentence of the article that would state the missing fact, in the register an
encyclopedia lead is written in: the entity, its category, its dates, its role, its nationality, its
field. That sentence is then handed to the index verbatim. It is usually wrong about the specific fact
-- that is fine and expected, nothing downstream ever reads it -- but it is right about the vocabulary
that surrounds the fact, and a lexical index scores a candidate abstract on precisely that vocabulary.
A dozen plausible co-occurring terms locate an article that three keywords cannot, and terms the guess
got wrong simply fail to match instead of misleading anything.

The synthesized leads never reach the answerer and are never treated as candidate answers: they exist
only to be scored against the corpus, so a confidently wrong guess costs a search and nothing else.

Calls: 3 LLM and 5-6 retrievals normally, 4 LLM and up to 9 retrievals when the grounding test fires.
