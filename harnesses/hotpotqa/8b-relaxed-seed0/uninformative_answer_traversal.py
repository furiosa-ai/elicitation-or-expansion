"""An INFORMATIVENESS test on the drafted answer that turns a collapsed answer into a forced traversal.

Mechanism change vs the parent (`grounded_answer_repair`). The parent tests whether the draft is
GROUNDED -- whether some read passage prints it. That test is blind to the single most common way a
two-article question fails: the pipeline never reaches the second article, and the answerer, unwilling
to say it does not know, hands back something the question itself already handed it. It names the
anchor the question named, or it names the article it was reading, or it retreats to `same`, `no one`,
`unrelated`, or a bare yes/no to a `who`/`what` question. Every one of those strings is printed in the
evidence, so the parent's grounding test passes them through untouched, and every one of them is a
non-answer: it carries no fact that was not already in the question.

This system adds a second, orthogonal gate. A draft is UNINFORMATIVE when all of its content words
already occur in the question, or when it is one of the degenerate refusals, or when it is yes/no for a
question that asks which/who/what. The gate is suppressed for selection questions -- those that lay out
alternatives and ask the reader to pick one -- because there the answer is supposed to come from the
question.

An uninformative draft is not rewritten and is not merely re-searched: it is read as a signal that the
BRIDGE WAS NEVER CROSSED, and the recovery crosses it explicitly. The collapsed string is taken as the
anchor, its own article is looked up by title, it is crossed with the property the question wants and
with the question's wh-head noun, and the question is re-answered over the refreshed pool with the
collapsed string named as forbidden and with the requirement that the answer name something the
question does not already name. The replacement is accepted only if it is both grounded in the new
evidence and informative; otherwise the original draft stands, so a false trigger costs a search round
and nothing else.

The two gates compose: groundedness catches drafts the evidence never printed, informativeness catches
drafts the evidence printed but the question already contained.

Calls: 3 LLM and 5-6 retrievals normally, 4 LLM and up to 9 retrievals when either gate fires.
