"""Memory that measures how far a query sits outside what it has learned from, and
changes how it presents itself when the answer is probably not one it knows.

Iteration 7 established the wall: on the large label space 78% of errors need an
answer string memory has never seen, and six retrieval mechanisms tied at 42-44%
because the pool they draw from structurally cannot contain the answer. What none
of them measured is that the wall is not uniform. Replaying the streams with a
query-side novelty score - the share of a query's character n-grams that have never
been observed before - splits that dataset into terciles whose realised accuracy is
0.476, 0.190 and 0.129, and whose share of answerable-from-memory cases is 0.683,
0.349 and 0.226. Memory can tell, BEFORE it answers, whether its own evidence is
worth anything here.

What it should do with that is not obvious, and the obvious answer is wrong. Hard
withdrawal was measured first: on the validation split, the attested shortlist still
contains a component of the correct answer on 5 of the 10 queries the router fires
for, so deleting it would destroy real evidence on half of them. What IS wrong on
those queries is the framing. In the regime where the correct answer has never been
seen, the model still emits an answer built only from previously-seen strings 59% of
the time - answers that are guaranteed wrong. It is reading the shortlist as a menu.

So nothing is removed and nothing is overruled. Above the cut the same evidence is
relabelled: the shortlist is presented as answers that belonged to other, dissimilar
cases, and the instructions explicitly license an answer that has never been used
here before. Below the cut the prompt is byte-identical to the base.

The cut is fitted, not set. A raw novelty score drifts downward as memory fills, so
the router ranks each query against a rolling window of recent ones and searches the
rank quantiles for the largest band whose realised accuracy is at most half the
memory's running rate. On the real streams that search finds a band on exactly the
dataset the profile predicts and finds NONE on the other two, where novelty has no
range and does not separate accuracy - so the router is silent there by construction
rather than by a per-task constant. Routed steps are scored against the band rate
that justified the routing, and the arm switches itself off if it falls behind.
Zero extra LLM calls; the prompt grows by one line where it fires.
