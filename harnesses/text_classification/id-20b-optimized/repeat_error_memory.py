"""The answerer's own record on the cases it is being shown.

Every system in this run stores what the answerer said on each graded step and
none of them ever shows it back. The case list renders `problem -> verified
answer` and drops the third fact the memory already owns for free: on 28% of the
cases it shows on the small closed label space, and 74% on the large one, the
answerer ALREADY GOT THAT CASE WRONG, and the memory knows exactly what it said.

That matters because the errors are repeats. Replaying the real streams through
the shipped ranker and measuring only cases that are already in the prompt:

* on 21 of the 45 errors on the small closed space, one of the twelve cases shown
  has the current problem's correct answer as its own verified answer AND was a
  case the answerer itself got wrong;
* on 31 of the 147 errors on the large space, a case shown carries a stored wrong
  answer that is the very answer being given again now.

So the prompt already contains the counter-example to the mistake in progress; it
just renders it with the mistake deleted. Here the case keeps it: a case the
answerer previously got wrong shows `first given:` alongside `A:`. Nothing is
reordered, nothing is added to or removed from the case list, and no answer is
overridden - the change is one line on cases that were going to be printed
anyway. Retrieval order, budget and every other channel are the base's.

Measured before writing: at four annotations per prompt, ordered so that a wrong
answer the memory has seen recur outranks a one-off, the channel costs +4.7% of
prompt characters and puts a directly relevant record in front of 26 of 45 and 26
of 147 errors respectively. One and two annotations cover materially less (14 and
6; 23 and 13); five cost more for one or two more. Where answers never repeat it
covers 0 of 46 errors and costs 8.5%, so it rides the same measured answer-reuse
gate the inventory already uses and the prompt there is byte-identical to the
base.

The line is phrased as a record of what happened on that case, not as a rule about
this problem: stating a true corpus-wide claim about answers in the instructions
has already cost six points in this run, and this is deliberately not one.
